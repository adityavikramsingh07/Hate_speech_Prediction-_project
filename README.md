ðŸ§  Hate Speech Prediction using Deep Learning Models

This project focuses on detecting **hate speech in text data** using multiple deep learning models including **Simple RNN**, **LSTM**, and **BERT**.

 Features

- Preprocessing of raw text data
- Vectorization using Tokenizers & Embeddings
- Model training using:
  - Simple RNN
  - LSTM
  - BERT (transformer-based)
- Evaluation of model performance (accuracy, F1-score)
- Visualizations for performance comparison
